Stopwatch Project

Overview :
This project is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a straightforward tool to measure elapsed time accurately.

Features: 
Start/Stop: Users can start and stop the stopwatch to measure elapsed time.
Pause/Resume: Pause functionality allows users to temporarily halt the stopwatch and then resume it without losing the elapsed time.
Reset: Users can reset the stopwatch to zero, clearing all previously measured time.
